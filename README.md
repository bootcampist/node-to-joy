## Description
The Profile Generator is a Node application that allows a Team Manager to generate a team profile containing the details of the employees who make up the team, based on the Team Managerâ€™s input. A photo of the employees can also be displayed. 
 
An example of the completed profile can be seen below, created for an imaginary company. The logo and profile pictures were generated using Midjourney 6.0 for the purposes of the example.
